    <h3 class="heading-3">Praveen Kumar L</h3>
    <h5 class="heading-5">Praveen Kumar L also affectionately called Rider Praveen, is an ex-gym instructor who gave up
        his job,<br>
        his means of livelihood, all his and his familyâ€™s assets and savings to start We Save Animals (WSA) Welfare
        Trust. From paralysed,
        blind, old-age animals to accident cases, cruelty cases and terminally ill animals - he takes them all in,
        giving them happiness,
        food and a home in his shelter.

    <h5 class="heading-6">I have been closely associated with WSA for about two years now and I have got to see
        Praveen's passion and dedication for the voiceless first hand. No matter the time of the day or place, if he can
        help an animal or a human in distress, he will do it. There is absolutely no second thoughts or doubts about
        that! I have seen him nurse & nurture back to health, many fatally injured and diseased animals upon whom even
        the vets had given up on and had suggested euthanasia. Today these animals are a living testimony to how
        unflinching care and compassion can make miracles happen and Praveen has made a lot of such miracles happen at
        his shelter. It gives me a great sense of satisfaction to be associated with WSA. A visit to this shelter puts a
        big smile on my heart, the very sight of animals who seem to be leading a "happily ever after" lives came here
        when they were battling for their very existence! I thank Praveen for this noble cause he has taken up,
        something for which he has made many unimaginable sacrifices in his own life. Its a service not just to the
        animals in need but for humanity.

    <h5 class="heading-5">I have visited WSA shelter with my friends and family every year. This shelter is a temple for
        many dogs who are hurt and can't be on the streets. I feel WSA shelter is not just any shelter. Unlike others
        where the animals are caged, here, they roam freely and happily. Praveen is doing a good job keeping them free.
        All the animals enjoy their freedom with good, healthy food and a clean environment. The staff is very helpful
        too. Praveen is doing a really good job. He is a Godfather for the animals.
