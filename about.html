    <h3 class="heading-3">How It Started:</h3>
    <h5 class="heading-5">
        <p>It started for Praveen in 2013, when he rescued a kitten with a<br>
            spinal injury. He nursed it at home, but it passed away after a week,<br>
            leaving Praveen to wonder what he could do to help numerous<br>
            animals like this, that suffer in silence. So he started by rescuing<br>
            injured animals, and keeping them at home. Soon, as the number of<br>
            rescues increased, he started looking for temporary shelters to<br>
            house them. Eventually, the news of his rescue got around and he<br>
            started attending to approximately 4-5 cases in a day were People<br>
            Use to tag him in social media Like Facebook etc. He took the help<br>
            of Dr. Girish from Blue Cross and Dr. Lohith frm Maruthi pet clinic<br>
            and started an account in their respective clinics, so that injured<br>
            animals could be attended to, without a delay due to the finances.<br>
            So as the number of rescues went up, so did the bill amount in the<br>
            clinics. But that did not deter Praveen. The word spread, and<br>
            Praveen, who was initially contacted for rescues only around South<br>
            Bangalore, started getting calls for help for cases in Mysore,<br>
            Mandya, Chikmagalur Hosur etc. To manage things better, Pravee<br>
            started a WhatsApp group With Just 6 People And started<br>
            attending To this cases full-time. He had no option but to give up<br>
            his job, financial help was low, but with his family standing behind<br>
            him, praveen kept doing whatever he could for the animals.</p>
